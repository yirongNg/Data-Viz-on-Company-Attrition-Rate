## üìñ Background
In this first ever BI competition, you will be exploring a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. You'll have to import, analyze, and visualize the data using Tableau.

The end goal will be a clean, self-explanatory, and interactive dashboard for the HR team of Atlas Labs. By conducting a thorough exploratory data analysis and creating visualizations, you'll dive deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees.

## üîç Findings

1. Atlas Lab has hired 1217 employees since 2013 and the average age of the employees in the company is around 30 years old, which is considered relatively young.

2. The total attrition rate for the company from 2013 to 2022 is 18.41% and Sales Department has the highest attrition rate of 24.18%, followed by Human Resources department and Technology department which had 22.64% and 15.50% attrition rate, respectively. However, the attrition rate has been decreasing since Year 2013 from a high rate of 84.38% to 19.77% on Year 2022.

3. High attrition rate comes from employees who worked less than 2 years in the company.

4. Factors that are likely to impact attrition are job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, work life balance, and salary.

5. Recommended actions to reduce attrition:
    - Increase salary for sales representatives, recruiters, data scientists, sales executives, and software engineers.
    - Allows hybrid working to improve work life balance.
    - Have more engagement with junior employees to build rapport.
