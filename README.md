## üìñ Background
In this first ever BI competition, you will be exploring a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. You'll have to import, analyze, and visualize the data using Tableau.

The end goal will be a clean, self-explanatory, and interactive dashboard for the HR team of Atlas Labs. By conducting a thorough exploratory data analysis and creating visualizations, you'll dive deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees.
